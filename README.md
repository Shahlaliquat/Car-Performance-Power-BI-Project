# Car-Performance-Power-BI-Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes car performance metrics to provide comprehensive comparisons and insights. By examining horsepower, acceleration, and fuel efficiency (MPG) across cars from different regions (US, Europe, Japan), we aim to highlight trends and patterns in car performance.

## Business Questions
- What factors influence car performance across different origins (US, Europe, Japan)?
- How do horsepower, MPG, and acceleration vary among car models from different regions?
- What are the maximum and minimum values for horsepower and acceleration for car models from different origins?

## Key Insights
1. *Performance Comparison by Origin*:
   - US cars generally have higher horsepower.
   - Japanese cars tend to have better acceleration.

2. *Horsepower Trends by Model*:
   - High horsepower models like the AMC Ambassador series.
   - Fuel-efficient models like the Honda Civic.
3. *MPG vs. Horsepower Analysis*:
   - Trade-offs between power and fuel efficiency.

4. *Overall Car Performance*:
   - US cars have larger engine displacements and more cylinders.

5. *Maximum Performance Metrics*:
   - Peak performance capabilities of cars from each region.

## Objectives
- Compare key performance indicators across different regions.
- Provide actionable insights for consumers and manufacturers.
- Create an interactive dashboard for easy data interpretation.
- Support strategic decision-making with data-driven insights.

## Recommendations
- Consumers: Choose cars based on a balance of horsepower and MPG.
- Manufacturers: Enhance acceleration and MPG to meet regional preferences.
- Marketers: Highlight key performance metrics based on target market preferences.

## Tools Used
- *Excel*: Data cleaning and preparation.
- *Power BI*: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- *Figma*: Design elements and layout planning.
