# Car-Performance-Power-BI-Project
## Project Overview
This project analyzes car performance metrics to provide comprehensive comparisons and insights. By examining horsepower (hp), acceleration (0-60 mph in seconds), fuel efficiency (MPG), engine displacement (cubic inches), and weight (lbs) across cars from different regions (US, Europe, Japan),  aim to highlight trends and patterns in car performance.

## Business Questions
- What factors influence car performance across different origins (US, Europe, Japan)?
- How do horsepower (hp), miles per gallon (MPG), and acceleration (0-60 mph in seconds) vary among car models from these regions?
- What are the peak and lowest values for horsepower and acceleration across various car models?

## Key Insights
1. **Performance Comparison by Origin**:
   - US cars generally have higher horsepower (hp).
   - Japanese cars have better acceleration (0-60 mph in seconds).

2. **Horsepower Trends by Model**:
   - Certain models, like the AMC Ambassador series, consistently show high horsepower values.
   - Other models, like the Honda Civic, exhibit lower horsepower but may compensate with other performance metrics such as fuel efficiency.

3. **MPG vs. Horsepower Analysis**:
   - Models like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic have high MPG but lower horsepower, indicating a focus on fuel efficiency.
   - Higher horsepower cars, like the Chevrolet Citation, tend to have lower MPG, suggesting a trade-off between power and fuel economy.

4. **Overall Car Performance**:
   - **Displacement and Cylinders**: US cars typically have larger engine displacements (cubic inches) and more cylinders compared to their European and Japanese counterparts.
   - **Average Horsepower and MPG by Cylinders**: A trend showing that cars with more cylinders generally have higher horsepower but lower MPG.

5. **Maximum Performance Metrics**:
   - **Displacement and Acceleration**: The dashboard highlights the maximum displacement (cubic inches) and acceleration (0-60 mph in seconds) values across different origins, showcasing the peak performance capabilities of cars from each region.

## Objectives
- Compare key performance indicators across different regions.
- Provide actionable insights for consumers and manufacturers.
- Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI and design elements from Figma to make complex data easily understandable.
- Support strategic decision-making with data-driven insights.

## Recommendations
- **For Consumers**: Choose cars based on a balanced view of horsepower and MPG, depending on whether performance or fuel efficiency is prioritized.
- **For Manufacturers**: Focus on enhancing acceleration and MPG to meet regional preferences and standards.
- **For Marketers**: Highlight the strengths of car models (e.g., high horsepower or fuel efficiency) based on the target market's preferences.

## Tools Used
- *Excel*: Data cleaning and preparation.
- *Power BI*: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
